I am working with cytoscape with fcos layout. ( i have several task, task have several children key_value now these key_value is connected to other task key_value) it doesn't connected with same task --- Using high value of node repulsion in fcos several key_value of both task form a cluster like patter.. so between two task it form 3 or 4 cluster like form. How to identify these cluster and link two task via cluster if anyone expand it then it able to see whole graph.
